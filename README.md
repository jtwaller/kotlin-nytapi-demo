# Kotlin NYT Api Demo

This application fetches articles from the New York Times api and displays results in a recycler view.  On click, articles will be loaded within a WebView with a share action provider included in the action bar.

If you intend to run this application you must include your NYT api key with articlesearch enabled into the ArticlesViewModel
